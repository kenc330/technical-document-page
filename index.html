                <p>All developers will use some kind of version control system (VCS), a tool to allow them
                    to
                    collaborate with other developers on a project without danger of them overwriting each
                    other's work,
                    and roll back to previous versions of the code base if a problem is discovered later on.
                    The most
                    popular VCS (at least among web developers) is Git, along with GitHub, a site that
                    provides hosting
                    for your repositories and several tools for working with them. This module aims to teach
                    you what
                    you need to know about both of them.</p>
                <p>VCSes are essential for software development:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is rare that you will work on a project completely on your own, and as soon as
                        you start
                        working with other people you start to run the risk of conflicting with each other's
                        work — this
                        is when both of you try to update the same piece of code at the same time. You need
                        to have some
                        kind of mechanism in place to manage the occurences, and help avoid loss of work as
                        a result.
                    </li>
                    <li>When working on a project on your own or with others, you'll want to be able to back
                        up the code
                        in a central place, so it is not lost if your computer breaks.
                    </li>
                    <li>You will also want to be able to roll back to earlier versions if a problem is later
                        discovered.
                        You might have started doing this in your own work by creating different versions of
                        the same
                        file, e.g. <code>myCode.js</code>, <code>myCode_v2.js</code>,
                        <code>myCode_v3.js</code>,
                        <code>myCode_final.js</code>, <code>myCode_really_really_final.js</code>, but this
                        is really error-prone and unreliable.
                    </li>
                    <li>Different team members will commonly want to create their own separate versions of
                        the code
                        (called <b>branches</b> in Git), work on a new feature in that version, and then get
                        it merged in a
                        controlled manner (in GitHub we use <b>pull requests</b>) with the master version
                        when they are done
                        with it.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>VCSes provide tools to meet the above needs. <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener">Git</a>
                    is an example of a VCS, and <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>
                    is
                    a web site +
                    infrastructure that provides a Git server plus a number of really useful tools for
                    working with git
                    repositories individually or in teams, such as reporting issues with the code, reviewing
                    tools,
                    project management features such as assigning tasks and task statuses, and more.</p>
                <p class="highlight"><b>Note:</b> Git is actually a distributed version control system,
                    meaning
                    that a complete copy
                    of the
                    repository containing the codebase is made on your computer (and everyone else's). You
                    make changes
                    to your own copy, and then push those changes back up to the server, where an
                    administrator will
                    decide whether to merge your changes with the master copy.</p>

                    <h2>prerequisites</h2>
                </header>
                <p>To use Git and GitHub, you need:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A desktop computer with Git installed on it (see the <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Git downloads page</a>).
                    </li>
                    <li>A tool to use Git. Depending on how you like to work, you could use a <a
                            href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Git GUI
                            client</a>
                        (we'd
                        recommend GitHub Desktop, SourceTree or Git Kraken) or just stick to using a
                        terminal window. In
                        fact, it is probably useful for you to get to know at least the basics of git
                        terminal commands,
                        even if you intend to use a GUI.
                    </li>
                    <li>A <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> GitHub account</a>. If you
                        haven't
                        already got
                        one, sign up now using the provided link.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In terms of prerequisite knowledge, you don't need to know anything about web
                    development, Git/GitHub
                    or VCSes to start this module. However, it is recommended that you know some coding so
                    that you have
                    reasonable computer literacy, and some code to store in your repositories!</p>
                <p>It is also preferrable that you have some basic terminal knowledge, so for example moving
                    between
                    directories, creating files, and modifying the system <code>PATH</code>.</p>
                <p class="highlight"><b>Note:</b> Github is not the only site/toolset you can use with Git.
                    There
                    are other
                    alternatives such as GitLab that you could try, and you could also try setting your own
                    Git server
                    up and using it instead of GitHub. We've only stuck with GitHub in this course to
                    provide a single
                    way that works.</p>

                            using
                            GitHub, learning the basics of Git such as creating repositories and branches,
                            making
                            commits, and opening and merging pull requests.</p>
                        <p>The <b>Hello World</b> project is a time-honored tradition in computer
                            programming.
                            It is a simple
                            exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Let’s get started

                                <p>A <b>repository</b> is usually used to organize a single project.
                                    Repositories can
                                    contain
                                    folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets –
                                    anything your
                                    project needs. We recommend including a <b><i>README</i></b>, or a file
                                    with
                                    information about
                                    your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you
                                    create your new

                                <p>By default your repository has one branch named <code>main</code> which
                                    is considered
                                    to be the
                                    definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before
                                    committing
                                    them to <code>main</code>.</p>
                                <p>When you create a branch off the <code>main</code> branch, you’re making
                                    a copy, or
                                    snapshot, of
                                    <code>main</code> as it was at that point in time. If someone else made

                                    the <code>main</code>
                                    branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those
                                    updates.

                                    a change is
                                    ready, they merge their branch into <code>main</code>.</p>

                        <h2>What’s a version control system?</h2>
                        <p>A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and
                            teams
                            collaborate on projects together. As the project evolves, teams can run tests,
                            fix bugs, and
                            contribute new code with the confidence that any version can be recovered at any
                            time.
                            Developers can review project history to find out:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Which changes were made?</li>
                            <li>Who made the changes?</li>
                            <li>When were the changes made?</li>
                            <li>Why were changes needed?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>What’s a distributed version control system?</h2>
                        <p>Git is an example of a distributed version control system (DVCS) commonly used
                            for open
                            source and commercial software development. DVCSs allow full access to every
                            file, branch,
                            and iteration of a project, and allows every user access to a full and
                            self-contained
                            history of all changes. Unlike once popular centralized version control systems,
                            DVCSs like
                            Git don’t need a constant connection to a central repository. Developers can
                            work anywhere
                            and collaborate asynchronously from any time zone.</p>
                        <p>Without version control, team members are subject to redundant tasks, slower
                            timelines, and
                            multiple copies of a single project. To eliminate unnecessary work, Git and
                            other VCSs give
                            each contributor a unified and consistent view of a project, surfacing work
                            that’s already
                            in progress. Seeing a transparent history of changes, who made them, and how
                            they contribute
                            to the development of a project helps team members stay aligned while working

                        <h2>Why Git?</h2>
                        <p>According to the latest <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stack Overflow
                                developer survey</a>, more than 70 percent of developers
                            use Git, making it the most-used VCS in the world. Git is commonly used for both
                            open source
                            and commercial software development, <b>with significant benefits</b> for
                            individuals, teams
                            and
                            businesses.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Git lets developers see the entire timeline of their changes, decisions, and
                                progression
                                of any project in one place. From the moment they access the history of a
                                project, the
                                developer has all the context they need to understand it and start
                                contributing.</li>
                            <li>Developers work in every time zone. With a DVCS like Git, collaboration can
                                happen any
                                time while maintaining source code integrity. Using branches, developers can
                                safely
                                propose changes to production code.</li>
                            <li>Businesses using Git can break down communication barriers between teams and
                                keep them
                                focused on doing their best work. Plus, Git makes it possible to align
                                experts across a
                                business to collaborate on major projects.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>What’s a repository?</h2>
                        <p>A repository, or <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git
                                project</a>,
                            encompasses
                            the entire
                            collection of files and folders
                            associated with a project, along with each file’s revision history. The file
                            history appears
                            as snapshots in time called commits, and the commits exist as a linked-list
                            relationship,
                            and can be organized into multiple lines of development called branches. Because
                            Git is a
                            DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and anyone who owns a copy of the
                            repository can
                            access the entire codebase and its history. Using the command line or other
                            ease-of-use
                            interfaces, a git repository also allows for: interaction with the history,
                            cloning,
                            creating branches, committing, merging, comparing changes across versions of
                            code, and more.
                        </p>
                        <p>Working in repositories keeps development projects organized and protected.
                            Developers are
                            encouraged to fix bugs, or create fresh features, without fear of derailing
                            mainline
                            development efforts. Git facilitates this through the use of topic branches:
                            lightweight
                            pointers to commits in history that can be easily created and deprecated when no
                            longer
                            needed.</p>
                        <p>Through platforms like GitHub, Git also provides more opportunities for project
                            transparency
                            and collaboration. Public repositories help teams work together to build the
                            best possible
                            final product.</p>
                        <h2>Basic Git commands</h2>
                        <p>To use Git, developers use specific commands to copy, create, change, and combine
                            code. These
                            commands can be executed directly from the command line or by using an
                            application like
                            <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Desktop</a> or
                            Git
                            Kraken. Here
                            are some common
                            commands for using Git:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>git init</code> initializes a brand new Git repository and begins
                                tracking an
                                existing
                                directory. It adds a hidden subfolder within the existing directory that
                                houses the
                                internal data structure required for version control.</li>
                            <li><code>git clone</code> creates a local copy of a project that already exists
                                remotely.
                                The clone
                                includes all the project’s files, history, and branches.</li>
                            <li><code>git add</code> stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer’s
                                codebase, but
                                it’s
                                necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the
                                project’s
                                history. This command performs staging, the first part of that two-step
                                process. Any
                                changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part
                                of the
                                project’s history. Staging and committing separately gives developers
                                complete control
                                over the history of their project without changing how they code and work.
                            </li>
                            <li><code>git commit</code> saves the snapshot to the project history and
                                completes the
                                change-tracking
                                process. In short, a commit functions like taking a photo. Anything that’s
                                been staged
                                with <code>git add</code> will become a part of the snapshot with
                                <code>git commit</code>.
                            </li>
                            <li><code>git status</code> shows the status of changes as untracked, modified,
                                or staged.
                            </li>
                            <li><code>git branch</code> shows the branches being worked on locally.</li>
                            <li><code>git merge</code> merges lines of development together. This command is
                                typically
                                used to
                                combine changes made on two distinct branches. For example, a developer
                                would merge when
                                they want to combine changes from a feature branch into the main branch for
                                deployment.
                            </li>
                            <li><code>git pull</code> updates the local line of development with updates
                                from its remote
                                counterpart.
                                Developers use this command if a teammate has made commits to a branch on a
                                remote, and
                                they would like to reflect those changes in their local environment.</li>
                            <li><code>git push</code> updates the remote repository with any commits made
                                locally to a
                                branch.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>How GitHub fits in</h2>
                        <p>GitHub is a Git hosting repository that provides developers with tools to ship
                            better code
                            through command line features, issues (threaded discussions), pull requests,
                            code review, or
                            the use of a collection of free and for-purchase apps in the GitHub Marketplace.
                            With
                            collaboration layers like the GitHub flow, a community of 15 million developers,
                            and an
                            ecosystem with hundreds of integrations, GitHub changes the way software is
                            built.</p>
                        <h2>How GitHub works</h2>
                        <p>GitHub builds collaboration directly into the development process. Work is
                            organized into
                            repositories, where developers can outline requirements or direction and set
                            expectations
                            for team members. Then, using the GitHub flow, developers simply create a branch
                            to work on
                            updates, commit changes to save them, open a pull request to propose and discuss
                            changes,
                            and merge pull requests once everyone is on the same page.</p>
                        <h2>The GitHub flow</h2>
                        <p>The GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow built around core Git
                            commands used
                            by teams around the globe—including ours.</p>
                        <p>The GitHub flow has six steps, each with distinct benefits when implemented:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Create a branch:</b> Topic branches created from the canonical deployment
                                branch
                                (usually
                                <code>main</code>) allow teams to contribute to many parallel efforts.
                                Short-lived topic
                                branches, in
                                particular, keep teams focused and results in quick ships.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Add commits:</b> Snapshots of development efforts within a branch create
                                safe,
                                revertible
                                points in the project’s history.</li>
                            <li><b>Open a pull request:</b> Pull requests publicize a project’s ongoing
                                efforts and set
                                the
                                tone for a transparent development process.</li>
                            <li><b>Discuss and review code:</b> Teams participate in code reviews by
                                commenting,
                                testing, and
                                reviewing open pull requests. Code review is at the core of an open and
                                participatory
                                culture.</li>
                            <li><b>Merge:</b> Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the
                                equivalent of a
                                local ‘git
                                merge’ operation. GitHub also keeps the entire branch development history on
                                the merged

                        <p>There are two primary ways people collaborate on GitHub:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Shared repository</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p>With a <i>shared repository</i>, individuals and teams are explicitly designated
                            as
                            contributors
                            with read, write, or administrator access. This simple permission structure,
                            combined with
                            features like protected branches and Marketplace, helps teams progress quickly
                            when they
                            adopt GitHub.</p>
                        <p>For an open source project, or for projects to which anyone can contribute,
                            managing
                            individual permissions can be challenging, but a <i>fork</i> and <i>pull</i>
                            model allows
                            anyone who can
                            view the project to contribute. A fork is a copy of a project under an
                            developer’s personal
                            account. Every developer has full control of their fork and is free to implement
                            a fix or
                            new feature. Work completed in forks is either kept separate, or is surfaced
                            back to the
                            original project via a pull request. There, maintainers can review the suggested
                            changes
                            before they’re merged. See the <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/"

                            This guide
                            explains how.</p>
                        <p>After using GitHub by yourself for a while, you may find yourself wanting to
                            contribute to
                            someone else’s project. Or maybe you’d like to use someone’s project as the
                            starting point
                            for your own. This process is known as <i>forking</i>.</p>
                        <p>Creating a “fork” is producing a personal copy of someone else’s project. Forks
                            act as a sort
                            of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit
                            <i>Pull
                                Requests</i> to help make other people’s projects better by offering your
                            changes up to
                            the
                            original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

                            producing a fork of someone else’s project, and arguably the most important. If
                            you’ve made
                            a change that you feel would benefit the community as a whole, you should
                            definitely
                            consider contributing back.</p>
                        <p>To do so, head on over to the repository on GitHub.com where your project lives.
                            For this
                            example, it would be at
                            <code>https://www.github.com/your_username/Spoon-Knife</code>.
                            After you refresh your web browser you’ll see a message indicating that “This

                            owner rejects your Pull Request, or asks for more information on why it’s been
                            made. It may
                            even be that the project owner chooses not to merge your pull request, and
                            that’s totally
                            okay. Your copy will exist in infamy on the Internet. And who knows–maybe
                            someone you’ve
                            never met will find your changes much more valuable than the original project.

                            repository on
                            GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential
                            changes with
                            collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the

                        <p>When you create a pull request, you can choose to create a pull request that is
                            ready for
                            review or a draft pull request. Draft pull requests cannot be merged, and code
                            owners are
                            not automatically requested to review draft pull requests. For more information
                            about
                            creating a draft pull request, see "<a

                        <p>When you're ready to get feedback on your pull request, you can mark your draft
                            pull request
                            as ready for review. Marking a pull request as ready for review will request
                            reviews from
                            any code owners. You can convert a pull request to a draft at any time. For more

                        <p>The compare and pull request pages use different methods to calculate the diff
                            for changed
                            files:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Compare pages show the diff between the tip of the head ref and the current
                                common
                                ancestor (that is, the merge base) of the head and base ref.</li>
                            <li>Pull request pages show the diff between the tip of the head ref and the
                                common ancestor
                                of the head and base ref at the time when the pull request was created.
                                Consequently,
                                the merge base used for the comparison might be different.</li>
